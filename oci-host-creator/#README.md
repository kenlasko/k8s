# Summary
Oracle Cloud has very limited capacity in the Always-Free tier. This script is used to continually hit Oracle Cloud to attempt to create a virtual machine when using the Always-Free tier of Oracle Cloud. Once the VM has been created, its no longer required to run. 

I have since switched to the Pay-As-You-Go plan, which doesn't have as stringent capacity issues. I've had no issues creating VMs in the UI, so this script is no longer required.
