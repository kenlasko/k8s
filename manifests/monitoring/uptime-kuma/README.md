# Introduction
[Uptime Kuma](https://github.com/k3rnelpan1c-dev/uptime-kuma-helm) is a tool that is useful for monitoring the availability of various resources. I use this to alert me to servers being down, SQL replication issues etc. Alerting is done via Slack.

Most configuration is done via my [custom Helm chart](/helm/baseline).
