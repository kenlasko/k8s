# Introduction
[Dawarich](https://github.com/Freika/dawarich) promises to be a replacement for Google's location tracker. Try as I might, Dawarich just doesn't have the ease-of-use of Google's solution. Tracks tend to go all over the place and don't make a lot of sense. It's currently not active in my cluster. I may revisit this in the future. 

Most configuration is done via my [custom Helm chart](/helm/baseline)
