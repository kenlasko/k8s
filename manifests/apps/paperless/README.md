# Introduction
[Paperless NGX](https://github.com/paperless-ngx/paperless-ngx) is an open-source document management system that digitizes, organizes, and makes searchable all your scanned and digital documents.

I haven't made much use of this yet. Been struggling to find a real use for it, instead of just relying on [Nextcloud](/manifests/apps/nextcloud). It is handy for digitized scans and whatnot, but I'm still not making full use of it.

It requires [PostgreSQL](/manifests/database/cnpg) and [Redis](/manifests/database/redis) to run.
