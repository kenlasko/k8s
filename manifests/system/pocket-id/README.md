# Summary
[Pocket-ID](https://github.com/pocket-id/pocket-id) is a simple and easy-to-use OIDC provider that allows users to authenticate with their passkeys to your services. As its description notes, it does exactly what it says on the tin. No muss, no fuss. I'm using this to provide OIDC logins for all apps that support it, including:
- [Grafana](/manifests/monitoring/promstack)
- [Mealie](/manifests/apps/mealie)
- [Pangolin](https://github.com/kenlasko/pangolin)
- [Paperless](/manifests/apps/paperless)
- [PGAdmin](/manifests/database/pgadmin)
- [Portainer](/manifests/apps/portainer)
- [Vaultwarden](/manifests/apps/vaultwarden)
