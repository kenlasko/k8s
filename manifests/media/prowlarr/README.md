# Summary
[Prowlarr](https://github.com/Prowlarr/Prowlarr) is an indexer manager/proxy built on the popular *arr .net/reactjs base stack to integrate with your various PVR apps, supporting management of both Torrent Trackers and Usenet Indexers. Instead of managing trackers/indexers on Radarr/Sonarr separately, its all consolidated throught Prowlarr.

Instead of the official image, I use the [11Notes](https://github.com/11notes/docker-prowlarr) rootless image, which is more secure than the base image.
