# Summary
[PHPMyAdmin](https://www.phpmyadmin.net/) is a web-based tool for managing [MariaDB](/manifests/mariadb) databases. With this tool, I am able to manage all my home-based MariaDB servers ([MariaDB Galera cluster](/manifests/mariadb), [MariaDB standalone](/manifests/mariadb-standalone), MariaDB on NAS).
