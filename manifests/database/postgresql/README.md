# Summary
This is a highly-available PostgreSQL cluster using the excellent [CloudNativePG Operator](https://cloudnative-pg.io/). Its configured as a 3-node cluster using local storage. It has live replication to a [remote PostgreSQL server running on Oracle Cloud](https://github.com/kenlasko/k8s-cloud/tree/main/manifests/database/postgresql).

## Backups
Constant backups are being made to a remote S3 bucket, which makes restoration very simple.

# Things I've Found
## Recovering from a failed node
I had a pod not come back properly after a node upgrade. Thankfully it was Home-3. The controller was throwing errors about being unable to connect to the pod, and the pod couldn't communicate with the controller. I tried to scale the cluster to 2 pods, but it kept failing to communicate with the pod.

I tried wiping out the local-disk contents, but that didn't work. Ultimately, the solution was to delete the PV/PVC associated with Home-3, and then scale the cluster back to 3 pods. Now that pod is known as Home-4, which is something CNPG or PG itself does to ensure a clean slate for the "new" pod.
