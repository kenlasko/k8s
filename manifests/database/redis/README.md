# Introduction
Redis is a fast, in-memory key-value database often used for caching, real-time data, and message brokering. Redis is used by the following applications:
- [ArgoCD](/argocd)
- [NextCloud](/manifests/apps/nextcloud)
- [Paperless](/manifests/apps/paperless)
- [Immich](/manifests/media-apps/immich)

Since it is an app that is required by ArgoCD, it is part of the initial [cluster bootstrapping process](/#initial-cluster-setup).
