  bootstrap:
    # Bootstrapping directly from the primary is extremely slow over Tailscale and takes over 10h. Not recommended
    # After the initial sync, the ongoing replication seems to fail on missing WALs, because the primary doesn't keep WALs for that long. 
    # Better to use the Backblaze S3 'home-cluster-backupsource'
    recovery:
      source: home-cluster-backupsource
  # The ongoing replication from the primary seems to work fine over Tailscale.
  # For initial replica sync, using the S3 source (home-cluster-backupsource) is much faster, but should switch
  # to the primary (home-postgresql) for ongoing replication. Otherwise, CNPG seems to continuously search for WALs that haven't
  # been archived to S3 yet. This causes high CPU load on the secondary, and probably incurs additional S3 costs as it continually
  # hits the S3 API.
  # Another reason to set the replica to S3 for the initial sync is because PG will load the base backup from the recovery source (ie S3),
  # but will switch to the replica source for the WALs. Since the primary cluster doesn't keep WALs for more than a few hours, this will probably fail.
