# Summary
This is a test of setting up a highly-available PostgreSQL cluster using the excellent [CloudNativePG Operator](https://cloudnative-pg.io/). It didn't take me long to have a fully-functional PG cluster that also automatically replicated to a remote PG server running on Oracle Cloud. 

I don't have any current use for PostgreSQL, but if I ever do, I'll be ready.
