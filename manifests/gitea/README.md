# Summary
[Gitea](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea) is a self-hosted Git repository. Its not actively used, but acts as a sort of backup in case something happens to Github. All my Github repositories are regularly pulled from Github and synced to Gitea, by following [this process](https://docs.gitea.com/usage/repo-mirror#pulling-from-a-remote-repository).

For more insurance against Github issues, I also use [Gickup](https://github.com/cooperspencer/gickup) to regularly backup my Github repositories to a local backup.

With all of these options, I should be able to recover from a Github disaster.
