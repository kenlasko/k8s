# We can extract the private key form a PFX to a PEM file with this command:
openssl pkcs12 -in filename.pfx -nocerts -out key.pem

# Exporting the certificate only:
openssl pkcs12 -in filename.pfx -clcerts -nokeys -out cert.pem

# Removing the password from the extracted private key:
openssl rsa -in key.pem -out server.key
